//! Intermediate representation of the input document that is used by the query engine to build
//! query ASTs and validate the incoming data.
//!
//! Helps decoupling the incoming protocol layer from the query engine, i.e. allows the query engine
//! to be agnostic to the actual protocol that is used on upper layers, as long as they translate
//! to this simple intermediate representation.
//!
//! The mapping illustrated with GraphQL (GQL):
//! - There can be multiple queries and/or mutations in one GQL request, usually designated by "query / {}" or "mutation".
//! - Inside the queries / mutations are fields in GQL. In Prisma, every one of those designates exactly one `Operation` with a `Selection`.
//! - Operations are broadly divided into reading (query in GQL) or writing (mutation).
//! - The field that designates the `Operation` pretty much exactly maps to a `Selection`:
//!    - It can have arguments,
//!    - it can be aliased,
//!    - it can have a number of nested selections (selection set in GQL).
//! - Arguments contain concrete values and complex subtypes that are parsed and validated by the query builders, and then used for querying data (input types in GQL).
