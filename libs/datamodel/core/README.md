# Parser Prototype for Prisma Datamodel v2

Language: Rust

Build System: Cargo

## Overview

This module is responsible for parsing a string representation of a Prisma datamodel V2, as well as rendering a datamodel to Prisma datamodel V2. The datamodel might include source blocks, so those are loaded as well.

![Architecture Overview](doc/images/overview.png?raw=true)

The validated and standardised **Datamodel** structure is the primary output of this module. For TS/JS applications, a serialized form in DMMF format is provided.

### Design goals

- Strict parsing: A duplicate attribute, unknown attribute, unknown argument or extra argument is an error.
- Ensure consistency of the output.
- Accumulate errors to present them at the end instead of throwing.

### Data Formats

**DMMF** Internal JSON format for transferring datamodel and schema information between different components of Prisma.

**Sources** represents the different data sources (e.g. database connectors) declared in the datamodel.

**Datamodel** is the datamodel data structure which is used by other Rust components of prisma.

**AST** is the internal AST representation of a Prisma datamodel V2 file.

**Datamodel V2 String** is the string representation of a Prisma datamodel V2 file.

### Steps

**Parse** parses a string to an AST and performs basic syntactic checks.

**Load Sources** Loads all source declarations. This injects source-specific attributes into the validation pipeline.

**Lift** converts an AST to a unvalidated datamodel by applying all attributes. Attributes might perform basic validation at this step.

**Validate** performs several checks to ensure the datamodel is valid. This includes, for example, checking invalid type references, or relations which are impossible to model on a database.

**Standardise** sets properties and adds fields and models which are implicitly given. For example. this would add back relation fields, relation tables, and relation's `to_fields`, if they were not explicitly set by the user. The sole purpose of this step is to make working with the generated data structure easier by removing corner cases.

**Convert to DMMF** converts a datamodel (or source) structure to an interal JSON representation used by other non-rust components.

**Convert from DMMF** converts the internal DMMF JSON representation of a datamodel to a datamodel structure.

**Lower** generates an AST from a datamodel. This step will attempt to minimize the AST by removing all attributes and attribute arguments which are a default anyway.

**Render** renders a given AST to it's string representation.

## Guarantees

For a parsed, validated and standardised datamodel, the following guarantees hold:

- Each referenced model or enum does exist.
- Each related field has a backwards related field on the related type with equal relation name. If the user did not specify any, a backwards field will be generated.
- All relations are named.
- All relations have a valid list of `to_fields` on the referencing side. An empty list indicates the back relation field. If the user does not give any `references` argument, the `to_fields` will point to the related types id fields.

**These Guarantees do not hold if a datamodel is loaded from DMMF**

## Error handling

The datamodel parser strives to provide good error diagnostics to schema
authors. As such, it has to be capable of dealing with partially broken input
and keep validating. The validation process can however not proceed to the
validating models in presence of a broken datasource, for example, because that
would lead to a cascade of misleading errors. Like other parsers, we introduce
*cutoff points* where validation will stop in the presence of errors.

These are:

- AST parsing stage. Syntax errors.
- Configuration validation
- Datamodel validation

## Usage

Please see [`lib.rs`](src/lib.rs) for all convenience method.

Main use-case, parsing a string to datamodel:

```
let file = fs::read_to_string(&args[1]).expect(&format!("Unable to open file {}", args[1]));

let datamodel = datamodel::parse(&file)?;
```

The `datamodel::errors` module contains a helper method for pretty-printing errors.
